<div class="point">
	<span class="tree">4</span> The renewable energy index helps consumer/developers/etc. compare how green the energy is that's used in different areas.
</div>

<div class="point">
<span class="tree">5</span>It takes into account a variety of factors about local renewable energy usage and boils them down into a single score from 1-10.
</div>

<div class="point"><span class="tree">6</span>This is like a city's walkability score, or on zillow/trulia/redfin it's like any of the ratings for schools etc. that you'd find</div>

<div class="point">
     <span class="tree">7</span>Can be used to help homebuyers comparison shop for green energy score, help gov't officials get a big picture view of their renewable energy usage, etc.
</div>


<div class="point">

	The kinds of data we use to compute this score include

      <li>local power company's mix of renewables</li>

      <li>local tax credits for making green upgrades to your home like solar panels</li>

      <li>projections of increased green energy production in the area from new installations that will soon be online</li>

BECAUSE WE WON'T BE ABLE TO SURVIVE OFF OF CHEAP NATURAL GAS ANYMORE</p>
<p>C02 emission is the highest it's ever been since 1980.</p>
<p>
Super interesting, right?
</p>
<p>That's why we're tackling this challenge.</p>
